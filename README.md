# Basis-Assignment
Repo created for the purpose of sharing the project/assignment with people at Basis for the purpose of validation.

Installation
Please install the pods before using *pod install* and then open the .xcworkspace to open the project.

-Deliberately used UICollectionView CustomFlowLayout for the card instead of the available Swipe Cards similar to Tinder since there had to be a way to go to the previous, a drag gesture would interfere with the show previous card gesture.
-Library used include Alamofire for network requests and ObjectMapper
-Went with clean UI focusing on the data, a touch of really subtle label for the progress
-Comments and commit messages with proper code structuring
-"Unit and Integration Test for the use cases" this has been on my learning list, don't know yet but would love to work on it

Hope you'll enjoy the Code.
